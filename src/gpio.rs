//! Named GPIO pin types

//! This module maps the GPIO pin names as described in the
//! [Pins and Signals section of the micro:bit site](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/edgeconnector/#pins-and-signals)
//! Where appropriate the pins are restricted with the appropriate `MODE`
//! from `nrf-hal`.
